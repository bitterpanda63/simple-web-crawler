# Simple web crawler
This was an interesting project to learn how web crawlers work, and I ended up running this for a bit and indexing 1M+ sites :)
I also ended up linking that db to meilisearch, and it worked ok for a search engine since the start urls where related a bit to what I would search (i.e. kuleuven.be, wikipedia.org, ...)
